# O-RAN Interface

A patched version of the [ns3-o-ran-e2](https://github.com/o-ran-sc/sim-ns3-o-ran-e2) module developed by [o-ran-sc](https://github.com/o-ran-sc). This module enables the support for running multiple terminations of O-RAN compliant E2 interface within the simulation. The patch contains changes to the module such as changing build tool from Waf to CMake so as to comply with the latest versions of ns-3.
